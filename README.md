# The coach

![The coach](img/coach.png)

The coach helps you find performance problems on your web page. You can think of the coach as a modern version of [YSlow](http://yslow.org/).

The core functionality of the Coach has been moved to [Coach-core](https://github.com/sitespeedio/coach-core).

The easiest way to use the Coach is to [run sitespeed.io](https://www.sitespeed.io/#docker).
